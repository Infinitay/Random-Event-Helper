# Random Event Helper
A RuneLite plugin to help solve random events by displaying solutions for each random event.

## Features
- Highlights the solution for each supported random event

## Supported Random Events
### [Surprise Exam](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Surprise%20Exam)
- Highlights the correct answer for both the matching cards and next item sequence
  - Implemented via relations and keywords to hopefully support any variation of the questions/answers
    - As a result of using keywords, there could be a chance the solutions are incorrect. If this is the case, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Infinitay/Random-Event-Solver/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) with a screenshot of the random event question.
    - _Disclaimer, the **relation matching system** was generated with AI, with me fixing the bugs and building upon the keywords._

### [Pinball](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pinball)
